# About

This is the code repository for [Hands-On Vuex for Vue.js Applications [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/hands-vuex-vuejs-applications-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789952469), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and NPM, preferably newer versions. Installations instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- An up-to-date browser like [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/).
- An editor or IDE (whatever you want, I'll be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).

## Installing and Running

First, clone the respository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-on-Vuex-for-Vue.js-Applications.git
```

Next, `cd` to the folder that you want to view, and run `npm install` to install its dependencies. Then, you can run `npm run serve` or `npm start` (for some later sections) to start the development server.

## Working With the Code

You might have noticed that there isn't a separate folder for each section. This is because some sections build on top of the work from earlier sections. It's still possible to view the code for those earlier sections, though.
Each video that contains code has two [`git` tags](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/inspecting-a-repository/git-tag) associated with it. One is called `step_pre_{video number}` and one is called `step_{video number}`, which represents the state of the code after the video is complete.

If you want to follow along with, say, video section **Code Organization Strategies** chapter **Creating the User Module**, first run `git checkout step_pre_5.3`, and then you can write the code as the video progresses. When you're done, you can check for any differences from the final code for that video by running `git diff step_5.3`. Or, you can just skip right to the finished state by running `git reset --hard` to clear your changes to the code, and then running `git checkout step_5.3`.

Video 4.2 is kind of an exception to this. There's a `step_pre_4.2` tag, but there are actually two different tags afterward: `step_4.2` and `step_4.2a`. These steps represent the two different approaches to organizing actions that we showed in the video.

In addition to the challenge of following the git tags, a viewer must also know which code folder is being used for each video and what command to use to run the code. The various apps created are stored in separate folders and have different commands to start them which can change as the course progresses. The following table will help a viewer know how to get the code to follow along with a given section of the video.

For example, to follow along and code with the video chapter **Creating the State and Mutations** from video section **Shopping List App** a person would run the following commands from the repo root:

```
> git checkout step_pre_2.1
> cd section-2-shopping-list
> npm run serve
```

## About the Video Course

Modern front-end applications can have complex states, with different ways to view and modify different pieces of data. Keeping the states of different views in sync can get really complicated quickly. Vuex, the official state management tool for Vue.js, makes your application’s state architecture easier to understand, maintain and evolve.
This course is the easiest way to get started with Vuex to improve your Vue application architecture and overall user experience. You will learn all about the Vuex API, including the Vuex store, changing application state, carrying out asynchronous operations and persisting state changes to a server. You will build a full reading tracker app that uses all of the core Vuex concepts in a real-world scenario that includes an API and user authentication. Later, you will learn about advanced techniques for testing and organizing complex Vuex applications. All of this will be taught in simple steps that gradually build up in complexity to ensure that you never fall behind.
By the end of this course, you will have created multiple projects with Vuex and will know how to build practical applications that are powerful, consistent, and maintainable. You will understand all aspects of Vuex development, and know how to put them into practice.
